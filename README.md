## Design  
###Logo
The School logo in this case was not used. Instead, the name of the company was used on the left side
of the navigation bar to continue with concept of clarity and simplicity, easily understood by all audiences.
The header/NavBar and footer are consistent in all areas of the website. Navigation is also easy and consistent.

The colours used are mostly Black and White which contrast each other and give a sense of elegance and clarity 
throughout the platform.   

###Pages, Header and Navigation
The website platform is responsive therefore it can be view in mobile, tablets and desktops. The header and footer
are consistent in all the pages of the platform only changing the main content area. Navigation bar / Header is also consistent
with the navigation buttons on the top right-hand side of the screen and the name of the company on the top-left side of the screen.

On devices tablet and mobiles the user will be able to expand/collapse this 3 line menu button that toggles down to 
access the menu items available.  

####Footer section  
The footer section only have the copyright info with space for future option s to be added later.   

### Wireframes  
Wireframe designs show navigation concepts for Mobile and Desktop views. Since, both the navbar/header and footer are consistent
throughout the application, wireframes were developed for the above-mentioned and for the main page only as the main content of 
the page is  changing section for every page.

#### NavBar/Header  
<details><summary>Mobile and Desktop NavBar</summary>
<img src="docs/Navigation.png" alt="wireframe screenshot of Movie2Archive Homepage on mobile"></details>

#### Homepage  
<details><summary>Main Homepage Concept</summary>
<img src="docs/home-wireframe.png" alt="wireframe screenshot of Movie2Archive Login page on mobile"></details>

<details><summary>footer</summary>
<img src="docs/Footer.png" alt="wireframe screenshot of Movie2Archive Login page on tablet"></details>

### Colour palette  
The web platform uses a black background (#212529) on header and footer with white (#FFFFFF) colour font providing good contrast.
The body is mostly the opposite, Black font against a white background. 

The web application for the buttons use different color depending on the function of the button, for example, in the
profile page the DELETE button is red (#DC3545) with white font. 

Contrast Grid was used to contrast combinations. Picture below of colours user on the entire web application.

### Contrast Check
 [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/) used to automatically check the pages. Results bellow:

### Typography
Fonts used across the application were provided by Blog Post a simple Bootstrap starter template from 
[Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template/blog-post). Include font like: 
Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue with default fall-back of Sans-Serif.

### Flowcharts and databases  
Flowchart shows the path for any web application user:.

## Deployment of Website

This website was developed and hosted using **GitHub pages** and stored in repositories on Github. 

PyCharm was use for the development environment and Git was installed as an extension.

 
The website was deployed using Github Pages and Heroku. To do this while in the github webpages of the project repository: 
1. on the menu that appears on the right-hand side of the page under 'Environments' you can find a link to `github-pages` with anc Active batch on the side.
2. Click on either, github-pages or Environments, it will take you to the `Deployment history` page.
3. Once on the Deployment history page on the right-hand side you will se a `View Deployment` button. 
4. Click on `View Deployment` and this will open the home page of the website in a new window.

Alternatively the links below can be use to directly open the website or go to the repositories:

## Technology
- GitHub was where the files were stored.
- PyCharm IDE as editing environment used to create and edit files.
